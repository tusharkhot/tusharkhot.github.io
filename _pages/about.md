I am a Lead Research Scientist at Allen Institure for AI (AI2), specializing in machine reasoning problems such as question answering and decision-making with LLMs. My research spans various aspects of solving complex reasoning tasks â€” building benchmarks, baselines and general-purpose solutions (incl. symbolic, neural and agent-based approaches).
